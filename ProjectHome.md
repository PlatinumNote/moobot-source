When i heard about neobot going down, i thought: "hmm, it would be nice to get that full market of his... lets do a clone so people dont need to learn new stuff... cuz people doesnt like changes...".

But after a while, my company took my all free time, and i resigned from finishing this bot...

Whats already done:
- tibia 9.44!
- independent HUD display (transparent and AA)
- full mouse and keyboard simulation.
- most of the container control and reading (all by mouse)
- most of the map control and reading
- most of chat stuff
- FULL packet parser (thx flash)
- hotkeys
- dat reader
- log
- lib loader
- almost fully functional neobot config loader (with virtual treeview)
- buggy healer
- job queue with prioritys and overriding
- lua 5.1 ready with most of the "presistant hotkey" functions done
- servercount(), itemcount and more
- and many many more...
